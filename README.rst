.. header-start-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove

The PennyLane Forest plugin allows different Rigetti devices to work with
PennyLane --- the wavefunction simulator, and the Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM).

`pyQuil <https://pyquil.readthedocs.io>`__ is a Python library for quantum programming using the
quantum instruction language (Quil) --- resulting quantum programs can be executed using the
`Rigetti Forest SDK <https://pyquil-docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/>`__ and the `Rigetti QCS
<https://qcs.rigetti.com/>`__.

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`__ is a cross-platform Python library for quantum machine
learning, automatic differentiation, and optimization of hybrid quantum-classical computations.

The plugin documentation can be found here: `<https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/forest>`__.

Features
========

* Provides three devices to be used with PennyLane: ``forest.numpy_wavefunction``,
  ``forest.wavefunction``, and ``forest.qvm``. These provide access to the pyQVM
  Numpy wavefunction simulator, Forest wavefunction simulator, and quantum
  virtual machine (QVM) respectively.


* All provided devices support all core qubit PennyLane operations and observables.


* Provides custom PennyLane operations to cover additional pyQuil operations:
  ``ISWAP``, ``PSWAP``, and ``CPHASE``. Every custom operation supports analytic
  differentiation.

* Combine Forest and the Rigetti Cloud Services with PennyLane's automatic differentiation and
  optimization.

Installation
============

PennyLane-Forest, as well as all required Python packages mentioned above, can be installed via ``pip``:
::

   	$ python -m pip install pennylane-forest


Make sure you are using the Python 3 version of pip.

Alternatively, you can install PennyLane-Forest from the source code by navigating to the top-level directory and running
::

	$ python setup.py install

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PennyLane-Forest requires the following libraries be installed:

* `Python <http://python.org/>`__ >=3.6

as well as the following Python packages:

* `PennyLane <http://pennylane.readthedocs.io/>`__
* `pyQuil <https://pyquil-docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/>`__ >=2.16, <2.28.3

Note that the latest PyQuil version 3.0 is not currently supported.

If you currently do not have Python 3 installed, we recommend
`Anaconda for Python 3 <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`__, a distributed version
of Python packaged for scientific computation.

Additionally, if you would like to compile the quantum instruction language (Quil) and run it
locally using a quantum virtual machine (QVM) server, you will need to download and install the
Forest software development kit (SDK):

* `Forest SDK <https://pyquil-docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/>`__

Alternatively, you may sign up for Rigetti's Quantum Cloud Services (QCS) to acquire a Quantum Machine
Image (QMI) which will allow you to compile your quantum code and run on real quantum processing units (QPUs),
or on a preinstalled QVM. Note that this requires a valid QCS account.

* `Quantum Cloud Services <https://docs.rigetti.com/en/>`__

Tests
~~~~~

To test that the PennyLane-Forest plugin is working correctly you can run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make test

in the source folder.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the HTML documentation, go to the top-level directory and run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ make docs


The documentation can then be found in the ``doc/_build/html/`` directory.
